   abstract = {A neural network model for a mechanism of visual pattern recognition is proposed in this paper. The network is self-organized by "learning without a teacher", and acquires an ability to recognize stimulus patterns based on the geometrical similarity (Gestalt) of their shapes without affected by their positions. This network is given a nickname "neocognitron". After completion of self-organization, the network has a structure similar to the hierarchy model of the visual nervous system proposed by Hubel and Wiesel. The network consists of an input layer (photoreceptor array) followed by a cascade connection of a number of modular structures, each of which is composed of two layers of cells connected in a cascade. The first layer of each module consists of "S-cells', which show characteristics similar to simple cells or lower order hyper-complex cells, and the second layer consists of "C-cells" similar to complex cells or higher order hypercomplex cells. The afferent synapses to each S-cell have plasticity and are modifiable. The network has an ability of unsupervised learning: We do not need any "teacher" during the process of self-organization, and it is only needed to present a set of stimulus patterns repeatedly to the input layer of the network. The network has been simulated on a digital computer. After repetitive presentation of a set of stimulus patterns, each stimulus pattern has become to elicit an output only from one of the C-cells of the last layer, and conversely, this C-cell has become selectively responsive only to that stimulus pattern. That is, none of the C-cells of the last layer responds to more than one stimulus pattern. The response of the C-cells of the last layer is not affected by the pattern's position at all. Neither is it affected by a small change in shape nor in size of the stimulus pattern.},

   abstract = {We propose a deep convolutional neural network architecture codenamed Inception that achieves the new state of the art for classification and detection in the Im-ageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2014 (ILSVRC14). The main hallmark of this architecture is the improved utilization of the computing resources inside the network. By a carefully crafted design, we increased the depth and width of the network while keeping the computational budget constant. To optimize quality, the architectural decisions were based on the Hebbian principle and the intuition of multi-scale processing. One particular in-carnation used in our submission for ILSVRC14 is called GoogLeNet, a 22 layers deep network, the quality of which is assessed in the context of classification and detection.},

@report{He2016,
   abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8Ã— deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions1, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

Since last two decades, researches related to the breast cancer has lead to extraordinary progress in our understanding of the disease, resulting in more efficient and less toxic treatments. Increased public awareness and improved screening have led to earlier diagnosis at stages amenable to complete surgical resection and curative therapies. Consequently, survival rates for breast cancer have improved significantly, particularly in younger women. This article addresses the types, causes, clinical symptoms and various approach both non-drug (such as surgery and radiation) and drug treatment (including chemotherapy, gene therapy etc.) of breast cancer.},

@article{Milosevic2018,
   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women. It is often characterized by a lack of early symptoms, which results in late detection of the disease. Detection at advanced stages of the decease implies the treatment is more difficult and uncertain. The appropriate screening programs have been conducted within the organized preventive examinations and have made significant contributions to the early breast cancer detection. OBJECTIVE: It is necessary to improve the screening process in order to reduce the percentage of female population that is not covered by screening programs and increase the number of early-detected breast cancers. The improvement of the screening program may be reflected in the following: more efficient determination of the list of the women who have to undergo preventive examination, introduction of screening program in thermography as a diagnostic method applied in pre-screening stage, more efficient analysis of mammograms and continuous follow up of patients. METHODS: The identification of target population for breast cancer screening program has been based on the age of women. The improvement of the early breast cancer diagnosis process proposed in this paper is reflected in more efficient determination of the group of women who have to undergo preventive examination based on the factors affecting the occurrence of breast cancer. Inclusion of the pre-screening phase in which thermal imaging could be applied and software support to mammographic detection of tumor are suggested. RESULTS: This paper describes the breast cancer, current screening program and techniques for early-stage breast cancer detection, module of medical information system MEDIS.NET for creating screening list based on the analysis of risk factors affecting the occurrence of breast cancer, mammography and role of thermal imaging in the process of early breast cancer detection. It also presents an overview on important achievements in computer-Aided detection and diagnosis of breast cancer in mammography and thermography. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the obtained results, dynamics of preventive examinations for particular groups of women that is different from the standard two-year examinations, can be successfully defined. It can be concluded that the use of a computer system for tumor diagnosis in mammogram based on various methods of image processing can help doctors in decision-making, while the use of thermal imaging in the pre-screening phase would significantly reduce the list of women for screening mammograms.},

@article{DeSantis2019,
   abstract = {This article is the American Cancer Society's biennial update on female breast cancer statistics in the United States, including data on incidence, mortality, survival, and screening. Over the most recent 5-year period (2012-2016), the breast cancer incidence rate increased slightly by 0.3% per year, largely because of rising rates of local stage and hormone receptor-positive disease. In contrast, the breast cancer death rate continues to decline, dropping 40% from 1989 to 2017 and translating to 375,900 breast cancer deaths averted. Notably, the pace of the decline has slowed from an annual decrease of 1.9% during 1998 through 2011 to 1.3% during 2011 through 2017, largely driven by the trend in white women. Consequently, the black-white disparity in breast cancer mortality has remained stable since 2011 after widening over the past 3 decades. Nevertheless, the death rate remains 40% higher in blacks (28.4 vs 20.3 deaths per 100,000) despite a lower incidence rate (126.7 vs 130.8); this disparity is magnified among black women aged <50 years, who have a death rate double that of whites. In the most recent 5-year period (2013-2017), the death rate declined in Hispanics (2.1% per year), blacks (1.5%), whites (1.0%), and Asians/Pacific Islanders (0.8%) but was stable in American Indians/Alaska Natives. However, by state, breast cancer mortality rates are no longer declining in Nebraska overall; in Colorado and Wisconsin in black women; and in Nebraska, Texas, and Virginia in white women. Breast cancer was the leading cause of cancer death in women (surpassing lung cancer) in four Southern and two Midwestern states among blacks and in Utah among whites during 2016-2017. Declines in breast cancer mortality could be accelerated by expanding access to high-quality prevention, early detection, and treatment services to all women.},
