   abstract = {A neural network model for a mechanism of visual pattern recognition is proposed in this paper. The network is self-organized by "learning without a teacher", and acquires an ability to recognize stimulus patterns based on the geometrical similarity (Gestalt) of their shapes without affected by their positions. This network is given a nickname "neocognitron". After completion of self-organization, the network has a structure similar to the hierarchy model of the visual nervous system proposed by Hubel and Wiesel. The network consists of an input layer (photoreceptor array) followed by a cascade connection of a number of modular structures, each of which is composed of two layers of cells connected in a cascade. The first layer of each module consists of "S-cells', which show characteristics similar to simple cells or lower order hyper-complex cells, and the second layer consists of "C-cells" similar to complex cells or higher order hypercomplex cells. The afferent synapses to each S-cell have plasticity and are modifiable. The network has an ability of unsupervised learning: We do not need any "teacher" during the process of self-organization, and it is only needed to present a set of stimulus patterns repeatedly to the input layer of the network. The network has been simulated on a digital computer. After repetitive presentation of a set of stimulus patterns, each stimulus pattern has become to elicit an output only from one of the C-cells of the last layer, and conversely, this C-cell has become selectively responsive only to that stimulus pattern. That is, none of the C-cells of the last layer responds to more than one stimulus pattern. The response of the C-cells of the last layer is not affected by the pattern's position at all. Neither is it affected by a small change in shape nor in size of the stimulus pattern.},

The main hallmark of this architecture is the improved utilization of the computing resources inside the network. By a carefully crafted design, we increased the depth and width of the network while keeping the computational budget constant. To optimize quality, the architectural decisions were based on the Hebbian principle and the intuition of multi-scale processing. One particular in-carnation used in our submission for ILSVRC14 is called GoogLeNet, a 22 layers deep network, the quality of which is assessed in the context of classification and detection.},

   abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8× deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions1, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

The development of a computerized system to distinguish mBR grade from entire estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) BCa histopathology slides will help clinicians identify grading discrepancies and improve overall confidence in the diagnostic result. In this paper, we isolate salient image features characterizing tumor morphology and texture to differentiate entire hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) stained histopathology slides based on mBR grade. The features are used in conjunction with a novel multi-field-of-view (multi-FOV) classifier - a whole-slide classifier that extracts features from a multitude of FOVs of varying sizes - to identify important image features at different FOV sizes. Image features utilized include those related to the spatial arrangement of cancer nuclei (i. e. , nuclear architecture) and the textural patterns within nuclei (i. e. , nuclear texture). Using slides from 126 ER+ patients (46 low, 60 intermediate, and 20 high mBR grade), our grading system was able to distinguish low versus high, low versus intermediate, and intermediate versus high grade patients with area under curve values of 0. 93, 0. 72, and 0. 74, respectively. Our results suggest that the multi-FOV classifier is able to 1) successfully discriminate low, medium, and high mBR grade and 2) identify specific image features at different FOV sizes that are important for distinguishing mBR grade in H and E stained ER+ BCa histology slides. {\textcopyright} 1964-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {In the diagnosis of preinvasive breast cancer, some of the intraductal proliferations pose a special challenge. The continuum of intraductal breast lesions includes the usual ductal hyperplasia (UDH), atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The current standard of care is to perform percutaneous needle biopsies for diagnosis of palpable and image-detected breast abnormalities. UDH is considered benign and patients diagnosed UDH undergo routine follow-up, whereas ADH and DCIS are considered actionable and patients diagnosed with these two subtypes get additional surgical procedures. About 250000 new cases of intraductal breast lesions are diagnosed every year. A conservative estimate would suggest that at least 50% of these patients are needlessly undergoing unnecessary surgeries. Thus, improvement in the diagnostic reproducibility and accuracy is critically important for effective clinical management of these patients. In this study, a prototype system for automatically classifying breast microscopic tissues to distinguish between UDH and actionable subtypes (ADH and DCIS) is introduced. This system automatically evaluates digitized slides of tissues for certain cytological criteria and classifies the tissues based on the quantitative features derived from the images. The system is trained using a total of 327 regions of interest (ROIs) collected across 62 patient cases and tested with a sequestered set of 149 ROIs collected across 33 patient cases. An overall accuracy of 87.9% is achieved on the entire test data. The test accuracy of 84.6% is obtained with borderline cases (26 of the 33 test cases) only, when compared against the diagnostic accuracies of nine pathologists on the same set (81.2% average), indicates that the system is highly competitive with the expert pathologists as a stand-alone diagnostic tool and has a great potential in improving diagnostic accuracy and reproducibility when used as a second reader in conjunction with the pathologists. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

Spectral clustering is used to reduce the dimensionality of the feature set. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier is used (1) to distinguish between cancerous and non-cancerous images, and (2) to distinguish between images containing low and high grades of cancer. Classification is repeated using different subsets of features to compare their performance.

abstract = {Progress in computing power and advances in medical imaging over recent decades have culminated in new opportunities for artificial intelligence (AI), computer vision, and using radiomics to facilitate clinical decision-making. These opportunities are growing in medical specialties, such as radiology, pathology, and oncology. As medical imaging and pathology are becoming increasingly digitized, it is recently recognized that harnessing data from digital images can yield parameters that reflect the underlying biology and physiology of various malignancies. This greater understanding of the behaviour of cancer can potentially improve on therapeutic strategies. In addition, the use of AI is particularly appealing in oncology to facilitate the detection of malignancies, to predict the likelihood of tumor response to treatments, and to prognosticate the patients' risk of cancer-related mortality. AI will be critical for identifying candidate biomarkers from digital imaging and developing robust and reliable predictive models. These models will be used to personalize oncologic treatment strategies, and identify confounding variables that are related to the complex biology of tumors and diversity of patient-related factors (ie, mining “big data”). This commentary describes the growing body of work focussed on AI for precision oncology. Advances in AI-driven computer vision and machine learning are opening new pathways that can potentially impact patient outcomes through response-guided adaptive treatments and targeted therapies based on radiomic and pathomic analysis.},

abstract = {Breast cancer is the leading cause of mortality in women. Early diagnosis of breast cancer can reduce the mortality rate. In the diagnosis, the mitotic cell count is an important biomarker for predicting the aggressiveness, prognosis, and grade of breast cancer. In general, pathologists manually examine histopathology images under high-resolution microscopes for the detection of mitotic cells. However, because of the minute differences between the mitotic and normal cells, this process is tiresome, time-consuming, and subjective. To overcome these challenges, artificial-intelligence-based (AI-based) techniques have been developed which automatically detect mitotic cells in the histopathology images. Such AI techniques accelerate the diagnosis and can be used as a second-opinion system for a medical doctor. Previously, conventional image-processing techniques were used for the detection of mitotic cells, which have low accuracy and high computational cost. Therefore, a number of deep-learning techniques that demonstrate outstanding performance and low computational cost were recently developed; however, they still require improvement in terms of accuracy and reliability. Therefore, we present a multistage mitotic-cell-detection method based on Faster region convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN) and deep CNNs. Two open datasets (international conference on pattern recognition (ICPR) 2012 and ICPR 2014 (MITOS-ATYPIA-14)) of breast cancer histopathology were used in our experiments. The experimental results showed that our method achieves the state-of-the-art results of 0.876 precision, 0.841 recall, and 0.858 F1-measure for the ICPR 2012 dataset, and 0.848 precision, 0.583 recall, and 0.691 F1-measure for the ICPR 2014 dataset, which were higher than those obtained using previous methods. Moreover, we tested the generalization capability of our technique by testing on the tumor proliferation assessment challenge 2016 (TUPAC16) dataset and found that our technique also performs well in a cross-dataset experiment which proved the generalization capability of our proposed technique.},

An automated and efficient approach not only aids in the diagnosis of breast cancer but also reduces human effort. In this paper, we develop an automated approach for the diagnosis of breast cancer tumors using histopathological images. In the proposed approach, we design a residual learning-based 152-layered convolutional neural network, named as ResHist for breast cancer histopathological image classification. ResHist model learns rich and discriminative features from the histopathological images and classifies histopathological images into benign and malignant classes. In addition, to enhance the performance of the developed model, we design a data augmentation technique, which is based on stain normalization, image patches generation, and affine transformation. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated on publicly available BreaKHis dataset. The proposed ResHist model achieves an accuracy of 84.34% and an F1-score of 90.49% for the classification of histopathological images. Also, this approach achieves an accuracy of 92.52% and F1-score of 93.45% when data augmentation is employed. The proposed approach outperforms the existing methodologies in the classification of benign and malignant histopathological images.

This study presents the histopathology image related to breast cancer cells detection (mitosis and non-mitosis). Mitosis is an important parameter for the prognosis/diagnosis of breast cancer. However, mitosis detection in histopathology image is a challenging problem that needs a deeper investigation. This is because mitosis consists of small objects with a variety of shapes, and is easily confused with some other objects or artefacts present in the image.

abstract = {This paper presents a deep learning approach for automatic detection and visual analysis of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) tissue regions in whole slide images (WSI) of breast cancer (BCa). Deep learning approaches are learn-from-data methods involving computational modeling of the learning process. This approach is similar to how human brain works using different interpretation levels or layers of most representative and useful features resulting into a hierarchical learned representation. These methods have been shown to outpace traditional approaches of most challenging problems in several areas such as speech recognition and object detection. Invasive breast cancer detection is a time consuming and challenging task primarily because it involves a pathologist scanning large swathes of benign regions to ultimately identify the areas of malignancy. Precise delineation of IDC in WSI is crucial to the subsequent estimation of grading tumor aggressiveness and predicting patient outcome. DL approaches are particularly adept at handling these types of problems, especially if a large number of samples are available for training, which would also ensure the generalizability of the learned features and classifier. The DL framework in this paper extends a number of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for visual semantic analysis of tumor regions for diagnosis support. The CNN is trained over a large amount of image patches (tissue regions) from WSI to learn a hierarchical part-based representation. The method was evaluated over a WSI dataset from 162 patients diagnosed with IDC. 113 slides were selected for training and 49 slides were held out for independent testing. Ground truth for quantitative evaluation was provided via expert delineation of the region of cancer by an expert pathologist on the digitized slides. The experimental evaluation was designed to measure classifier accuracy in detecting IDC tissue regions in WSI. Our method yielded the best quantitative results for automatic detection of IDC regions in WSI in terms of F-measure and balanced accuracy (71.80%, 84.23%), in comparison with an approach using handcrafted image features (color, texture and edges, nuclear textural and architecture), and a machine learning classifier for invasive tumor classification using a Random Forest. The best performing handcrafted features were fuzzy color histogram (67.53%, 78.74%) and RGB histogram (66.64%, 77.24%). Our results also suggest that at least some of the tissue classification mistakes (false positives and false negatives) were less due to any fundamental problems associated with the approach, than the inherent limitations in obtaining a very highly granular annotation of the diseased area of interest by an expert pathologist. {\textcopyright} 2014 SPIE.},

@article{Parwani2016,
abstract = {Background: Deep learning (DL) is a representation learning approach ideally suited for image analysis challenges in digital pathology (DP). The variety of image analysis tasks in the context of DP includes detection and counting (e.g., mitotic events), segmentation (e.g., nuclei), and tissue classification (e.g., cancerous vs. non-cancerous). Unfortunately, issues with slide preparation, variations in staining and scanning across sites, and vendor platforms, as well as biological variance, such as the presentation of different grades of disease, make these image analysis tasks particularly challenging. Traditional approaches, wherein domain-specific cues are manually identified and developed into task-specific "handcrafted" features, can require extensive tuning to accommodate these variances. However, DL takes a more domain agnostic approach combining both feature discovery and implementation to maximally discriminate between the classes of interest. While DL approaches have performed well in a few DP related image analysis tasks, such as detection and tissue classification, the currently available open source tools and tutorials do not provide guidance on challenges such as (a) selecting appropriate magnification, (b) managing errors in annotations in the training (or learning) dataset, and (c) identifying a suitable training set containing information rich exemplars. These foundational concepts, which are needed to successfully translate the DL paradigm to DP tasks, are non-trivial for (i) DL experts with minimal digital histology experience, and (ii) DP and image processing experts with minimal DL experience, to derive on their own, thus meriting a dedicated tutorial. Aims: This paper investigates these concepts through seven unique DP tasks as use cases to elucidate techniques needed to produce comparable, and in many cases, superior to results from the state-of-the-art hand-crafted feature-based classification approaches. Results: Specifically, in this tutorial on DL for DP image analysis, we show how an open source framework (Caffe)},

The results of simulations performed with those methods are then presented. Among the methods reviewed here, some perform the adaptation of the momentum term, either by itself or in parallel with learning rate adaptation.},

@article{Milosevic2018,
   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women. It is often characterized by a lack of early symptoms, which results in late detection of the disease. Detection at advanced stages of the decease implies the treatment is more difficult and uncertain. The appropriate screening programs have been conducted within the organized preventive examinations and have made significant contributions to the early breast cancer detection. OBJECTIVE: It is necessary to improve the screening process in order to reduce the percentage of female population that is not covered by screening programs and increase the number of early-detected breast cancers. The improvement of the screening program may be reflected in the following: more efficient determination of the list of the women who have to undergo preventive examination, introduction of screening program in thermography as a diagnostic method applied in pre-screening stage, more efficient analysis of mammograms and continuous follow up of patients. METHODS: The identification of target population for breast cancer screening program has been based on the age of women. The improvement of the early breast cancer diagnosis process proposed in this paper is reflected in more efficient determination of the group of women who have to undergo preventive examination based on the factors affecting the occurrence of breast cancer. Inclusion of the pre-screening phase in which thermal imaging could be applied and software support to mammographic detection of tumor are suggested. RESULTS: This paper describes the breast cancer, current screening program and techniques for early-stage breast cancer detection, module of medical information system MEDIS.NET for creating screening list based on the analysis of risk factors affecting the occurrence of breast cancer, mammography and role of thermal imaging in the process of early breast cancer detection. It also presents an overview on important achievements in computer-Aided detection and diagnosis of breast cancer in mammography and thermography. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the obtained results, dynamics of preventive examinations for particular groups of women that is different from the standard two-year examinations, can be successfully defined. It can be concluded that the use of a computer system for tumor diagnosis in mammogram based on various methods of image processing can help doctors in decision-making, while the use of thermal imaging in the pre-screening phase would significantly reduce the list of women for screening mammograms.},

@article{DeSantis2019,
   abstract = {This article is the American Cancer Society's biennial update on female breast cancer statistics in the United States, including data on incidence, mortality, survival, and screening. Over the most recent 5-year period (2012-2016), the breast cancer incidence rate increased slightly by 0.3% per year, largely because of rising rates of local stage and hormone receptor-positive disease. In contrast, the breast cancer death rate continues to decline, dropping 40% from 1989 to 2017 and translating to 375,900 breast cancer deaths averted. Notably, the pace of the decline has slowed from an annual decrease of 1.9% during 1998 through 2011 to 1.3% during 2011 through 2017, largely driven by the trend in white women. Consequently, the black-white disparity in breast cancer mortality has remained stable since 2011 after widening over the past 3 decades. Nevertheless, the death rate remains 40% higher in blacks (28.4 vs 20.3 deaths per 100,000) despite a lower incidence rate (126.7 vs 130.8); this disparity is magnified among black women aged <50 years, who have a death rate double that of whites. In the most recent 5-year period (2013-2017), the death rate declined in Hispanics (2.1% per year), blacks (1.5%), whites (1.0%), and Asians/Pacific Islanders (0.8%) but was stable in American Indians/Alaska Natives. However, by state, breast cancer mortality rates are no longer declining in Nebraska overall; in Colorado and Wisconsin in black women; and in Nebraska, Texas, and Virginia in white women. Breast cancer was the leading cause of cancer death in women (surpassing lung cancer) in four Southern and two Midwestern states among blacks and in Utah among whites during 2016-2017. Declines in breast cancer mortality could be accelerated by expanding access to high-quality prevention, early detection, and treatment services to all women.},

@article{Hu2017,
   abstract = {The central building block of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is the convolution operator, which enables networks to construct informative features by fusing both spatial and channel-wise information within local receptive fields at each layer. A broad range of prior research has investigated the spatial component of this relationship, seeking to strengthen the representational power of a CNN by enhancing the quality of spatial encodings throughout its feature hierarchy. In this work, we focus instead on the channel relationship and propose a novel architectural unit, which we term the "Squeeze-and-Excitation" (SE) block, that adaptively recalibrates channel-wise feature responses by explicitly modelling interdependencies between channels. We show that these blocks can be stacked together to form SENet architectures that generalise extremely effectively across different datasets. We further demonstrate that SE blocks bring significant improvements in performance for existing state-of-the-art CNNs at slight additional computational cost. Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks formed the foundation of our ILSVRC 2017 classification submission which won first place and reduced the top-5 error to 2.251%, surpassing the winning entry of 2016 by a relative improvement of ~25%.

@article{Zhao2021,
   abstract = {In this paper, we extend the classic MaxOut strategy, originally designed for Multiple Layer Preceptors (MLPs), into COnvolutional MaxOut (COMO) - a new strategy making deep convolutional neural networks wider with parameter efficiency. Compared to the existing solutions, such as ResNeXt for ResNet or Inception for VGG-alikes, COMO works well on both linear architectures and the ones with skipped connections and residual blocks. More specifically, COMO adopts a novel split-transform-merge paradigm that extends the layers with spatial resolution reduction into multiple parallel splits. For the layer with COMO, each split passes the input feature maps through a 4D convolution operator with independent batch normalization operators for transformation, then merge into the aggregated output of the original sizes through max-pooling. Such a strategy is expected to tackle the potential classification accuracy degradation due to the spatial resolution reduction, by incorporating the multiple splits and max-pooling-based feature selection. Our experiment using a wide range of deep architectures shows that COMO can significantly improve the classification accuracy of ResNet/VGG-alike networks based on a large number of benchmark datasets. COMO further outperforms the existing solutions, e.g., Inceptions, ResNeXts, SE-ResNet, and Xception, that make networks wider, and it dominates in the comparison of accuracy versus parameter sizes.},

@report{Xie2017,
   abstract = {We present a simple, highly modularized network architecture for image classification. Our network is constructed by repeating a building block that aggregates a set of transformations with the same topology. Our simple design results in a homogeneous, multi-branch architecture that has only a few hyper-parameters to set. This strategy exposes a new dimension, which we call "cardinality" (the size of the set of transformations), as an essential factor in addition to the dimensions of depth and width. On the ImageNet-1K dataset, we empirically show that even under the restricted condition of maintaining complexity, increasing cardinality is able to improve classification accuracy. Moreover, increasing cardinality is more effective than going deeper or wider when we increase the capacity. Our models, named ResNeXt, are the foundations of our entry to the ILSVRC 2016 classification task in which we secured 2nd place. We further investigate ResNeXt on an ImageNet-5K set and the COCO detection set, also showing better results than its ResNet counterpart. The code and models are publicly available online 1 .},

These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results.

   abstract = {Convolutional networks are at the core of most state-of-the-art computer vision solutions for a wide variety of tasks. Since 2014 very deep convolutional networks started to become mainstream, yielding substantial gains in various benchmarks. Although increased model size and computational cost tend to translate to immediate quality gains for most tasks (as long as enough labeled data is provided for training), computational efficiency and low parameter count are still enabling factors for various use cases such as mobile vision and big-data scenarios. Here we explore ways to scale up networks in ways that aim at utilizing the added computation as efficiently as possible by suitably factorized convolutions and aggressive regularization. We benchmark our methods on the ILSVRC 2012 classification challenge validation set demonstrate substantial gains over the state of the art: 21.2% top-1 and 5.6% top-5 error for single frame evaluation using a network with a computational cost of 5 billion multiply-adds per inference and with using less than 25 million parameters. With an ensemble of 4 models and multi-crop evaluation, we report 3.5% top-5 error on the validation set (3.6% error on the test set) and 17.3% top-1 error on the validation set.},

   abstract = {Very deep convolutional networks have been central to the largest advances in image recognition performance in recent years. One example is the Inception architecture that has been shown to achieve very good performance at relatively low computational cost. Recently, the introduction of residual connections in conjunction with a more traditional architecture has yielded state-of-the-art performance in the 2015 ILSVRC challenge; its performance was similar to the lat-est generation Inception-v3 network. This raises the question: Are there any benefits to combining Inception architec-tures with residual connections? Here we give clear empirical evidence that training with residual connections accelerates the training of Inception networks significantly. There is also some evidence of residual Inception networks out-performing similarly expensive Inception networks without residual connections by a thin margin. We also present several new streamlined architectures for both residual and non-residual Inception networks. These variations improve the single-frame recognition performance on the ILSVRC 2012 classification task significantly. We further demonstrate how proper activation scaling stabilizes the training of very wide residual Inception networks. With an ensemble of three residual and one Inception-v4 networks, we achieve 3.08% top-5 error on the test set of the ImageNet classification (CLS) challenge .},

   abstract = {Recent work has shown that convolutional networks can be substantially deeper, more accurate, and efficient to train if they contain shorter connections between layers close to the input and those close to the output. In this paper, we embrace this observation and introduce the Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet), which connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. Whereas traditional convolutional networks with L layers have L connections - one between each layer and its subsequent layer - our network has L(L+1)/2 direct connections. For each layer, the feature-maps of all preceding layers are used as inputs, and its own feature-maps are used as inputs into all subsequent layers. DenseNets have several compelling advantages: they alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem, strengthen feature propagation, encourage feature reuse, and substantially reduce the number of parameters. We evaluate our proposed architecture on four highly competitive object recognition benchmark tasks (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet). DenseNets obtain significant improvements over the state-of-the-art on most of them, whilst requiring less computation to achieve high performance.
